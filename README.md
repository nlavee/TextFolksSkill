# Text Folks

I own an Amazon Echo and has been very fascinated with what I could do with it. I noticed that everyone in my house usually text for some common tasks. Therefore, I decided to port this common texts into a skill for Alexa.  
This is has been adapted from [Alexa Skills Kit Samples](https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit).

Since my housemates is diverse enough to have representatives from different continents/countries/cities, that's how I am currently identifying people. If two people are from the same country, I would reduce the granularity to city (e.g. I have a few people from America)   

The current continent/countries/cities represented are:

* Kenya (@nlavee - me)
* Japan
* Asia
* Vietnam
* China
* New York

The current topics of that I need to text include:

* Ordering Chipotle ("Anyone wants to order Chipotle?")
* Home ("Is anyone home?"
* Test (Send test texts)

This was a fun hack. You can contact me at anhvu.nguyenlam@gmail.com or vu.nguyen@skidmore.edu.
